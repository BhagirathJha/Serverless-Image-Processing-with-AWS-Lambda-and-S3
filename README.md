## üì¶ Project Overview

This project implements a **serverless image processing using AWS Lambda and S3** on AWS. When a user uploads an image to the source S3 bucket, an event notification automatically triggers a Lambda function that resizes the image and stores the processed version in a destination S3 bucket. The images are then efficiently delivere through **CloudFront CDN**. Infrastructure is managed using **Terraform** with HCL.

## üìÅ Components

### S3 Buckets
- source-bucket: Accepts original image uploads.
- Destination-bucket: Stores resized images post Lambda processing.

### Lambda Function:
- Triggered by S3 upload events.
- Resizes images using a predefined configuration (e.g., max width/height).
- Uploads resized images to the destination bucket.

### CloudFront Distribution:
- Provides secure, low-latency access to both uploaded and resized images.
- Acts as the only public-facing endpoint.
- Uses Origin Access Control (OAC) to securely access S3.

## üîê Security Architecture
#### This project is designed with AWS Well-Architected Security Best Practices in mind:

‚úÖ IAM
- IAM roles and policies strictly follow least privilege principles.
- Lambda only has access to required S3 buckets and CloudWatch logs.

üõ°Ô∏è AWS Shield
- CloudFront is protected by AWS Shield Standard, which helps mitigate DDoS attacks.

üìä CloudWatch
- Lambda function logs and metrics are pushed to Amazon CloudWatch for observability.
- Monitors execution time, error rates, and invocations.

üîê CloudFront (Security & Performance)
- Acts as a secure front-end, blocking direct S3 access.
- Enforces HTTPS-only connections with TLS.
- Optional signed URLs for restricted or time-limited access.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload and Access Images

- Upload an image via the CloudFront upload endpoint.
- The image is resized via Lambda and stored in the destination bucket.
- Access the resized image via the CloudFront public URL.

## üéØ Output
- ‚úÖ Input: Original image uploaded via CloudFront to S3.
- ‚úÖ Process: Lambda resizes the image on event trigger.
- ‚úÖ Output: Resized image is accessible securely via CloudFront.

## üß± AWS Well-Architected Framework Alignment

### 1. Operational Excellence
- Terraform enables versioned and repeatable infrastructure.
- CloudWatch logging and metrics allow effective monitoring and alerting.

### 2. Security
- IAM, CloudFront, AWS Shield, and encryption enforce strict security.
- S3 buckets are private; CloudFront OAC controls access.
- Optional signed URLs can limit public access to resized images.

### 3. Reliability
- Serverless architecture automatically scales across multiple AZs.
- S3 provides high durability (11 nines).
- Lambda handles retries and failures.

### 4. Performance Efficiency
- CloudFront delivers images close to the user with caching.
- Lambda functions scale automatically and only run when triggered.

### 5. Cost Optimization
- No always-on infrastructure ‚Äî pay only for what you use.
- Smaller resized images reduce S3 storage cost.
- CloudFront caching reduces Lambda invocation frequency.
